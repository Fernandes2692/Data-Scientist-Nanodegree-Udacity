# Data Scientist Nanodegree (Udacity)

Welcome :octocat:

In this repository you will find projects I have completed as part of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Program. 

## Project 1: Introduction to Data Science - Write A Data Science Blog Post
This work aims to follow the CRISP-DM process, exhibit technical skills, and communicate insights by way of a blog post.
The topic of this project was chosen as a personal interest but also to raise awareness on the health of one of the most popular pets in the UK.

## Project 2: Data Engineering - Disaster Response Pipeline
In data engineering for data scientists, you will practice building ETL, NLP, and machine learning pipelines to categorise emergency messages based on the needs communicated by the sender.
This project is provided by our industry partner [Appen](https://appen.com/) to build a model for an API that classifies disaster messages. </br>
