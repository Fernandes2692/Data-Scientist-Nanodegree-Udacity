# Data Scientist Nanodegree (Udacity)

Welcome :octocat:

In this repository you will find projects I have completed as part of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Program. 

## Project 1: Introduction to Data Science - Write A Data Science Blog Post
This work aims to follow the CRISP-DM process, exhibit technical skills, and communicate insights by way of a blog post.
The topic of this project was chosen as a personal interest but also to raise awareness on the health of one of the most popular pets in the UK.

## Project 2: Data Engineering - Disaster Response Pipeline
In data engineering for data scientists, you will practice building ETL, NLP, and machine learning pipelines to categorise emergency messages based on the needs communicated by the sender.
This project is provided by our industry partner [Appen](https://appen.com/) to build a model for an API that classifies disaster messages. </br>

## Project 3: Experimental Design & Recommendations - Recommendations with IBM
For this project you will analyse the interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform, and make recommendations to them about new articles you think they will like. In order to determine which articles to show to each user, you will be performing a study of the data available on the IBM Watson Studio platform. </br>

## Project 4: Data Scientist Capstone Project 
My capstone project is based on data from the SETI Breakthrough Listen challenge.
In this project I use data science skills to help accurately classify simulated signals planted in scans of Breakthrough Listen targets using machine learning-based models.
